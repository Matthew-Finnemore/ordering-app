# Jimmy's Diner Ordering App

This is one of the first projects that I have made since returning to coding since having to have a break, it has been a great refresher and I feel happy with the project.

## Description

I built a web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application has a form and a modal window. The modal window was created using the new dialog element, which I found to be very useful. In the JavaScript, I used an event listener on the whole document to catch the user's clicks. I then used if statements to see if the click target was on an element that I wanted to trigger an action. This is the first time I have used this method, as previously I would add an event listener to each specific element. I also used JavaScript to map over arrays to produce the elements on the page, and to add and remove classes. I also performed some basic array manipulation and sums.
### Features

- Form
- Arrays
- eventListeners
- .map()


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


### Problems

I found when trying to access the click event on my `<i>` tag for the + sign you had to be exactly on the plus, this was not giving me the UX that I wanted, I found the CSS property to null the click event on the element and would then give the id of the `<div>` which contained the `<i>` which gave a much better UX.

### Conclusion

I really enjoyed working on this project. It was challenging enough to keep me engaged, but not so challenging that I got frustrated. I learned a lot of new things, and I feel like I have a much better understanding of the core concepts. I would like to add some more features to the app in the future, but I'm going to wait until I've learned some new methods. I'm excited to see what I can do with the app once I have more experience.
